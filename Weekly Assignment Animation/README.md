# Spritesheet

Demo: https://youtu.be/cxh2i57S-Wc

For this week's assignment, I wanted to do something with the spritesheet animation.

I did a lot of research on addons, [https://github.com/stfj/ofxSpriteSheetRenderer](tried a few), but every code I tried to run either didn't compile properly and crashed right away.

After two hours of struggle, I decided to implement this on my own. So I started off using a vector of images, all of which I have pre-cropped on my own as .getPixels() and .crop() also didn't work for me. After this, I just loop through images whenever the down key is pressed. Here is the [https://youtu.be/cxh2i57S-Wc](demo).

As of now, the animation is only supported for going down, but I want to develop this project more and make it into a small game for my second big assignment.
